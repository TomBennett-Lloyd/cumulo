# Friction log

Weak signals from `/retro` that don't yet have a clear improvement action — recorded so patterns become visible across tasks ("we churn on X in half of tasks") instead of being forced into premature lessons. `/triage` mines this for repeats (≥3 similar entries, or affecting ≥50% of recent tasks) and converts patterns into workflow issues, deleting captured entries. Singletons stay until they repeat or go stale.

- Phase: implementation
- Observed: `python -m venv` writes a `.gitignore` inside the venv so git ignores it, but Prettier's `format:check` does not honour nested `.gitignore` files — a worktree that `git status` calls clean still produced transient format reds until the venv path was excluded.
