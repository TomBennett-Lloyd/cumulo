# Tech-debt log

A **buffer, not an archive**. `/review-loop` appends SYSTEMIC findings here instead of iterating on them; `/triage` periodically clusters entries, files root-cause GitHub issues, and **deletes** what it captured. A long-lived entry here means triage is overdue.

Entry format:

```
## YYYY-MM-DD — short title
- Where: file/module references
- What: the pattern or problem (symptom AND suspected root cause if known)
- Source: PR/issue #
```

Pointers must survive unrelated edits: cite **files and symbol or section names** (function names, headings, config keys, script names) — never bare line numbers, and never a copied code literal unless the literal itself is the finding. An entry that pins its claim to `file.sh`:42 sends its reader to whatever happens to sit at line 42 months later. Applies to entries dated 2026-07-31 onward; the back catalogue is retrofitted opportunistically, whenever an entry is edited for any other reason.

## 2026-07-30 — `aws_budgets_budget.cost_types` left at AWS defaults

- Where: `infra/bootstrap/budget.tf` (`aws_budgets_budget.monthly_cost_ceiling`)
- What: no `cost_types` block, so the budget uses the AWS defaults, which subtract credits and refunds. On an account carrying promotional credits the meter can therefore run well past $100/month of gross usage while net cost stays under threshold and nothing alerts — the alarm reports what will be billed, not what is being consumed. That is a defensible reading of "cost ceiling" for a project whose ceiling is about the bank balance, and it is the current deliberate choice; it stops being defensible the moment credits land on the account, because the whole point of the ceiling is to catch runaway usage _before_ it is expensive. Revisit if credits appear (or before any AWS-credits programme is used for this project): either add `cost_types { include_credit = true, include_refund = false }`, or add a second usage-oriented budget beside the billed-cost one. Not a fix for this diff — it is a policy decision about what the number means, and it wants the account's credit state as an input.

- Triage note (2026-07-31): deliberately left in the buffer rather than filed. It is a parked decision with an external trigger (credits appearing on the account), not debt to clear — an open issue would be picked up by backlog burning and correctly do nothing. Convert it the moment the trigger fires.
